TurboTravel, a product of TurboTech Innovations, LLC, is a cost-effective mobility guidance web app that provides an elegant solution to a modern traveling problem. In the past, we have found that in order to find the most cost-effective means of travel, we often spend countless hours scouring different apps and websites for the best prices, whether it be for ride-hailing or air travel. With this full stack application, you simply enter your start and end destination addresses, and the real-time estimated price of UBER and LYFT will be displayed side-by-side, allowing you to choose the best travel method. TurboTravel has also been developed to detect and compare prices for long-distance travel.

If your travel trip is accessible by flight, then you will be provided with the cheapest airfare currently available, along with any important flight details (flight date, airline name, and start/destination airport names). Based on your inputted addresses, the closest airports will also be given according to its geographical locations. To further contribute to the most convenient and hassle-free travel experience, we even include a link for you to book your flight!
